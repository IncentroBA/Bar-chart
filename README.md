## BarChart

Display a simple single-line barchart based on listview-style data input. The item type is configurable and the amount
can be of any (positive) range of numbers starting from 0.

## Features

Set listview context within the app and configure chart value (`Integer`) and value names (`string`).

Configure the colors that will be used for each item in the list. The widget uses an array of 6 default colors.

Both the bar legend and the bar chart segments can be hovered to see some additional information inside a tooltip.

Sorting options: The results can be sorted by name, value or even via custom attribute (`Integer`).

Legend orientation: Set the orientation in which the legend is displayed (`horizontal`, `vertical`).

Show/hide percentage indicators (`boolean`).

Display rounded corners (`boolean`).

Display units alongside the numbers (`String`). This can be anything like cm, kg, %, EUR, â‚¬, $, ...

Display the units before or after the value (`Enumeration`).

   `npm -v`, execute: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`.
1. Run `npm start` to watch for code changes. On every change:
    - the widget will be bundled;
    - the bundle will be included in a `dist` folder in the root directory of the project;
